Why a blog? In an age of YouTube, X, StackOverflow, and AI, is there any room left for the dated art of putting ~~pen to paper~~ finger to keyboard? I believe it would be quite rudimentary to make a pragmatic justification for the existence of yet another blog, but although I am already convinced of the value this blog could bring, I have far a simpler reason for creating this site: I want to write about the things I enjoy, and I _really_ enjoy programming.

Strangely enough, my first foray into programming was through PowerPoint. Nothing as sophisticated as [this entertaining PowerPoint demonstration](https://youtu.be/_3loq22TxSc), since I couldn't have been older than 8 or 9 at the time, but through the convoluted use of links and transitions, I built a few basic point-and-click games. When I showed these projects to my dad, who worked as a software developer for Autodesk at the time, he introduced me to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). That sealed my fate; Pandora’s Box could not be shut.

Shortly after that, I discovered game development in [the Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/) with C# (again through my dad), built a character tracker and dice engine for Lego roleplaying with HTML and JavaScript, learned C++ in an online class, earned a B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science, attended a 16-week web development bootcamp, and landed my first job as a software engineer in August of 2020. I have worked in the industry ever since.

It’s said that the quickest way to kill a passion is to turn it into a job. Thankfully, I avoided that curse. Not to say that professional software development is without its drudgery. I could live without the company politics, the Jira stories, the hours of meetings, and more, but it has truly been a blessing to make a living doing what I love; few people have such an opportunity. Through all of it, the sense of wonder and the immense feeling of accomplishment each time I build something new has not faded in the slightest compared to what I experienced more than 15 years ago when I first linked two slides in PowerPoint.

The only way I can characterize the adventures I have had on my computer is as a series of journeys, some longer than others, where each step has deepened my understanding of and appreciation for the world of tech. These journeys have heretofore remained undocumented, but I want to change that with this blog. Just as the recorded journeys of many others have helped me navigate the frequently confusing digital landscape, I hope that my own experiences can provide also provide some clarity for at least one other individual, even if that individual is my future self!

My intention is journalistic, rather than educational, although I am certain you will learn something if you stick around long enough. The best journeys, in my opinion, are those that meander, so you will see a lot of that here. If that is not your cup of tea, I understand, but if I have managed to hold your attention for these 6 paragraphs, and if you would like to read further, then I warmly invite you to follow me to our first journey as we explore a new iteration of an old piece of software, a functional DSL, and what cats have to do with any of it.
